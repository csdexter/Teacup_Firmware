Generic 3-axis CNC Firmware for Arduino

Based upon Teacup Firmware by Michael Moon which was forked on 2012-07-26

This is the code of the CNC Control Panel project and this folder contains the
code for the motion control MCU. The code for the user interface (panel) MCU is
located TBD.

See README.Teacup for description of original code and licensing.

To the furthest extent that this is legally possible, the fork maintained by 
Radu - Eosif Mihailescu and published here https://github.com/csdexter/CNCControlPanel
is hereby released under the LGPL version 3.
To the furthest extent that this is legally enforceable, the copyright remains
with the authors listed above.

See the generated Doxygen documentation to learn how to interface with the
code: http://csdexter.github.com/Teacup_Firmware

NOTES:
 * the firmware image resulting from compiling this code should be uploaded to 
   the MCU connected to the stepper controller (Heiz Zero3 in our case)
 * it contains motion planning routines and takes care of moving the CNC around
   under the command of the user interface (panel) MCU which, in turn, issues
   commands to us based on parsed G-code or user interaction

maintainer at <radu.mihailescu@linux360.ro>.
